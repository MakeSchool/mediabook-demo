# Concept Check-in

Variables store a value that can change. What are some real-world examples of values that change over time?

[Solution]
One example could be a variable named `lebron_james_team'.  The initial value of `lebron_james_team` would be the first basketball team that Lebron James played with: the Cavaliers. In 2018, Lebron James moved teams, so our variable value would be reassigned to the Los Angeles Lakers.
