# Variable Tables

Let's practice an easy way of keeping track of variables and their values when we read more complicated code: variable tables.

A variable table includes the variable name and value at each line of code.

For this section of code:

```python
# Here are two variables that store data representing scores for a video game
my_score = 30
high_score = 60

#let's use variable reassignment to update the scores!
my_score = 31
high_score = 99
high_score = my_score
```

The variable table would look like this:

| Line # | Variable   | Value |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| 2      | my_score   | 30    |
| 3      | high_score | 60    |
| 6      | my_score   | 31    |
| 7      | my_score   | 99    |
| 8      | high_score | 99    |

Let's look at the table entry for line 8: can you explain in your own words why the value in the table is 99?

Candy break! Draw your own variable table by walking through each line of the following code.

</Action>

```python
# Let's count some candy bars
number_of_kit_kats = 20
number_of_skittles = 70
number_of_hi_chews = 15

number_of_kit_kats = 88
number_of_skittles = number_of_kit_kats
number_of_kit_kats = number_of_hi_chews
number_of_hi_chews = number_of_skittles
```
