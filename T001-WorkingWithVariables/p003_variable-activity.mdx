# What is a variable table?

Let's practice an easy way of keeping track of variables and their values when we read more complicated code: **Variable Tables**.

**Variable tables** include variable names along with their values at each line of code to help you understand how the value changes throughout a program. Let's look at at how they are created:

This is a section of code to store score values in a video game.

```python
# Here are two variables that store data representing scores for a video game
my_score = 30
high_score = 60

#let's use variable reassignment to update the scores!
my_score = 31
high_score = 99
high_score = my_score
```

The variable table for this code contains each line of code in order and looks like this:

| Line # | Variable   | Value |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| 2      | my_score   | 30    |
| 3      | high_score | 60    |
| 6      | my_score   | 31    |
| 7      | my_score   | 99    |
| 8      | high_score | 99    |

Let's look at the table entry for line 8: can you explain in your own words why the value in the table is 99?

## Create Your Own Variable Table

<Action>

Candy break! Draw your own variable table by walking through each line of the following code.

</Action>

```python
# Let's count some candy bars
number_of_kit_kats = 20
number_of_skittles = 70
number_of_hi_chews = 15

number_of_kit_kats = 88
number_of_skittles = number_of_kit_kats
number_of_kit_kats = number_of_hi_chews
number_of_hi_chews = number_of_skittles
```

## Check Your Understanding
