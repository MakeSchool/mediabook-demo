# Variables Check-in

Check your understanding of variables in Python with these question. Remember that you can always revisit the Variables video to review these concepts.

<FlashCard prompt={"In your own words, can you describe what a variable is in Python?"} explanation={"In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of a variable as a box. Each box has a label called the variable name and contains a value. Variables can be initialized and reassigned to new values."} />

<FlashCard prompt={"Let's imagine we are going to write a program in Python to run an automated grocery checkout. What are three variables with descriptive names that we might want to store in our program?"} explanation={"Some examples are: item_price which stores the price value of a scanned item, customer_total which stores the total value of all of the items that a customer has scanned, and daily_customers which stores the number of customers that have used the checkout today"} />
