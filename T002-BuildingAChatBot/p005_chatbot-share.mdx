# Share Your Chat Bot!

Great work creating your very own Chat Bot! :tada:

Now that you can combine all of your Python skills into one cohesive project, the sky's the limit on what you can create moving forward.

:movie_camera: The final step is to show off your project on social media and the course Discord. Create and upload a video following the instructions on the demo page: remember to introduce yourself, describe your Chat Bot's theme, and show off each cool feature you've added. 

You can also check out other student's chat bots and leave them comments and kudos.

## Demo Your Chat Bot

If you would like to demo your project at one of our weekly demo sessions, sign up on the course Discord. This is a great way to practice presenting your work and see what students in every Mediabook course have been building!
